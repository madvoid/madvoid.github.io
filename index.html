I am a mechanical engineer that has a lot of interdisciplinary experience in environmental science, data science, and embedded systems. I love good design and good data. This website serves as an expansion to my CV; it gives me the opportunity to describe my projects in just a little more detail. Navigation is in the top right, and my contact information is below. Enjoy!</p>
