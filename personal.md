So, I have many interests outside of my career, and I will attempt to list them here in a not-so-serious and not-so-comprehensive way:



* I enjoy lifting heavy iron weights and putting them back down
* I enjoy running, biking, swimming, and hiking - basically anything that will get me away from predators
* I enjoy camping, especially in the Utah desert
* I have a lifelong fascination with animals, especially the unique ones
* I love reading and libraries. I do most of my nonfiction reading on the internet, and most of my fiction reading with books
* I, like most other millenials, love traveling. The best parts of traveling is the nature, the food, and the culture, in that order.
* Speaking of food, I love food. A lot.
* Finally, I want to be a good photographer. I should probably buy something better than an iPhone to take pictures though...
