## University of Toulouse III

In the early part of 2017, I was a visiting researcher at the University of Toulouse III, though I resided at [CEA Cadarache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadarache) for almost all of my stay. While at CEA, I aided other researchers with a field experiment they were conducting studying atmospheric stability in complex terrain. I maintaned the LEMSv2 (which I designed) and analyzed the data produced by them. Happily, the LEMSv2 performed very well and were quite reliable throughout the entire field experiment. The data from this experiment were used to help write my [second paper](/projects/phd) on predicting wind fields using artificial neural networks. The following image shows the LEMSv2 deployed at Cadarache.

## Los Alamos National Lab

During the summer of 2013, I was a student at the Los Alamos Dynamics Summer School at Los Alamos National Lab. This lab mostly focused on structural health monitoring, an important sub discipline of civil engineering. While there, my team and I worked on building a quadcopter that could pneumatically launch a sensor at a target. Since mounting sensors on structures to monitor their health can be [expensive](http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/SYST490/490_2014_BI/BIS_FinalReport.pdf), inspectors can save costs by having a quadcopter do it.

My main task for this project was to design and implement an object-tracking program using C++ and openCV for the quadcopter to locate and fly to itâ€™s target. I then ported this program to an Android phone so it could run on the quadcopter directly. Finally, I helped design and build the pneumatic launcher that was used to launch the sensor. The following image shows the quadcopter with the projectile launching mechanism attached to it.

## Engineering Institute Korea

My work at the Engineering Institute - Korea (EIK) in the summer of 2014 also had to do with structural health monitoring. The senior graduate student I worked with was developing a system that used piezoelectric transducers and wavelet theory to monitor the structural health of airplane wings and other structures. I developed a microcontroller system that would send, read, and process a wavelet signal. This involved analog/digital circuitry design and MSP430 programming. The following image shows the type of wavelet used to excite the piezoelectric transducer.

## Hydroponics

A fellow PhD student and I designed and built a consumer hydroponics box with the intent to sell. This box was designed to look good, grow plants easily, and be relatively inexpensive. The hydroponics part itself was an ebb and flow system, and the grow chamber was partially temperature controlled. We grew many different commonly used culinary plants (herbs, lettuce, etc.), and they all grew well. The pictures below show the hydroponic box in action.

## Other

- I am currently working with Dr. Hari Sundar in the University of Utah Computer Science department to develop an algorithm to quickly factorize large matrices. The algorithm is implemented in C++ and uses MPI. This work stems from a class project I worked on for a class that Dr. Sundar taught.
- I have consulted for a couple student startups - an medical inhaler startup and an oil worker who runs his own business.
